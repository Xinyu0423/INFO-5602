## Semester Took this Course
Spring 2022

## Grade
A

## Note for This Class
1. This class is not a CS class, in my opinion, this class is suitable for those who are interested in data engineering. This class will teach a lot of data visualization methods, but because it is not a CS class, the code part is relatively simple.
2. There may be an in class exercise in each class. Therefore, it is better not to be absent. And you need to write a journal related to data visualization every week, which can usually be done in 30 minutes. Overall, the amount of homework in this class is not too large.
